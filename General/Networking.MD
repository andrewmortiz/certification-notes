## Networking
### OSI Model
- Layer 7: Application
- Layer 6: Presentation
- Layer 5: Session
- Layer 4: Transport
- Layer 3: Network
- Layer 2: Data Link
  - Frames: How information is sent over a local network.
    - Components
      - Preamble - Start of frame used to synchronize the sender and receiver clocks and prepare the receiver for data reception.
      - Source/Destination MAC address or All Fs for broadcast.
      - EtherType - Type/Length of data in frame.
      - Payload - Actual data.
      - Frame Check Sum - checksum used to detect errors in the frame.
  - Carrier Sense Multiple Access
    - Listens for data before transmitting
- Layer 1: Physical
  - Physical mediums
    - Ethernet/Fiber Optics cable
    - Wifi Signals
    - Hubs
  - Issues
    - No collision detection / access cibtrik
    - All devices can receive / transmit at the same time
    - No addressing, devices are not uniquely identified
