## Networking
### OSI Model
- Layer 7: Application
- Layer 6: Presentation
- Layer 5: Session
- Layer 4: Transport
- Layer 3: Network
  - Contains the IP protocol / Address
    - Allows multiple Layer 2 or Local Area Networks to have data routed between them.
    - Dotted-decimal notated with 4 fields with ranges of 0-255
    - First two fields are network
    - Second two fields are host
    - The dotted-decimal notation is human friendly short hand for binary where each field represnts and 8 bit peice of binary
    - Assigned by DHCP
  - Packets
    - Components
      - Source IP Address
      - Destination IP Address
      - Protocol
        - Identifies the Layer 4 protocol
          - TCP
          - UDP
          - ICMP
      - Time to Live
        - How long an IP address will try to reach its destination before expiring.
      - Data
- Layer 2: Data Link
  - Mac Address Layer
  - Frames: How information is sent over a local network.
    - Components
      - Preamble - Start of frame used to synchronize the sender and receiver clocks and prepare the receiver for data reception.
      - Source/Destination MAC address or All Fs for broadcast.
      - EtherType - Type/Length of data in frame.
      - Payload - Actual data.
      - Frame Check Sum - checksum used to detect errors in the frame.
  - Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection
    - Listens for carrier signal before transmitting to avoid collision
    - Jam signal and randomized "back-off" period before reattempting if a collision is detected
  - Devices
    - Networking Card
    - Switch
- Layer 1: Physical
  - Physical mediums
    - Ethernet/Fiber Optics cable
    - Wifi Signals
    - Hubs
  - Issues
    - No collision detection / access cibtrik
    - All devices can receive / transmit at the same time
    - No addressing, devices are not uniquely identified
  - Devices
    - Hubs - repeat traffic to all connected devices

### Subnets
- Deleniates between the host and network component of the IP address
- Allows a HOST to determing if they should communicate locally or use the gateway to communicate remotely
