"What are the 7 layers of the OSI model?";"1.  Physical
2.  Data Link
3.  Network
4.  Transport
5.  Session
6.  Presentation
7.  Application"
"What are the two groupings in the OSI Model?";"1.  Media layers (1-3) - how the data is moved.
2.  Host Layers (4-7) - how data is separated and reassembled for transport"
"What is Layer 1 and how is it defined?";"Physical: The physical transmission/reception of raw data between a shared physical medium.
It is a non-addressed broadcast signal.
Example: Ethernet Cable, Fiber Optics Cable, WiFi, Hub"
"What are the issues with Layer 1?";"All devices can transmit at the same to with no access control/collision detection.  No devices are uniquely addressable. "
"What is a MAC Address and its components?";"MAC Address is an ID uniquely assigned to a piece of hardware.  
The two components of a MAC address are the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and the NIC (Network Interface Controller) identifier.
The OUI is a unique identifier that is assigned to the manufacturer of the network interface card or device.
The NIC identifier is a unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer to the network interface card or device itself."
"How is data communicated over Layer 2?";"Frames"
"What are the components of a frame?";"1.  Preable - identifies the start of a frame.
2.  Destination/Source MAC Address ( can be broadcast by using all f's)
3.  EtherType - identitifes the layer 3 protocol that put data into the frame to indicates the type of data that follows in the frame, or the length of the frame.
4.  Payload -  the actual data being transmitted
5.  Frame Check Sequence ( FCS ) - A 4-byte field that contains a checksum that is used to detect errors in the frame."
"What is CSMA?";"Carrier Sense Multiple Access - Layer 2 protocol that has a device listen before transmitting data"
